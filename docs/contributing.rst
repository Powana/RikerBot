Before You Start
================

Please `open an issue`_ describing what feature you're looking to implement or
bug you're trying to fix. That way we can coordinate on the best strategy and
have a channel to troubleshoot issues. There's no set issue template, just try
to be descriptive and open to followup questions and feedback.


Get the Source
==============

The prefered option is to fork the `Github repo`_, develop features on that
fork, and make a PR.

Alternatively source code cloned from upstream with::

  git clone https://github.com/SpockBotMC/RikerBot.git


Style Guidelines
================

The repository root includes ``.clang-format`` and ``.style.yapf`` files for
use with clang-format and yapf when coding in C++ and Python respectively.
Please format code with these tools before submitting a PR.

Submitting a PR
===============

When opening a PR on the repo be sure to reference the associated issue number
in at least one commit message the PR description itself. The PR must be able
to merge cleanly against the master branch.
